# Command Line Interface (CLI)

Bunxyz comes with a helpful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, typically invoked as `bunxyz`, designed to streamline common development tasks like project creation and potentially generating boilerplate code in the future.

## Installation

If you haven't already, you can install the CLI globally using Bun:

```bash title="Install Bunxyz CLI"
bun add -g @bunxyz/cli
# Use code with caution.
```

Verify the installation by running:

```bash
bunxyz --version
# or
bunxyz -v
# Use code with caution.
```

This should print the installed version number of the CLI.

## Available Commands

### bunxyz create

This is the primary command used to scaffold a new Bunxyz project.

**Usage:**

```bash
bunxyz create <project-name> [options]
# Use code with caution.
```

**Arguments:**

- `<project-name>` (Required): The name of the directory where the new project will be created.

**Example:**

```bash
bunxyz create my-api
# Use code with caution.
```

This will create a `my-api` directory containing the default Bunxyz project template, ready for you to `cd` into, run `bun install`, and start with `bun dev`.
