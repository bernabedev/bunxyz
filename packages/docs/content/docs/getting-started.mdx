# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment and creating your first Bunxyz application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed. Bunxyz is built specifically for Bun. You can install it via their official website or using the command:

```bash title="Install Bun (if you haven't already)"
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# Use code with caution.
# Mdx
# (Refer to the official Bun documentation for alternative installation methods).
```

## Installation (CLI)

The recommended way to start a new Bunxyz project is by using the official Command Line Interface (CLI).

If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it globally using Bun:

```bash title="Install Bunxyz CLI globally"
bun add -g bunxyz-cli
# Use code with caution.
```

Alternatively, if you are developing the framework itself and have the monorepo set up, you can link your local build:

```bash title="Link local CLI (for framework developers)"
# Navigate to the CLI package within the monorepo
cd path/to/bunxyz-monorepo/packages/bunxyz-cli
# Create the global link
bun link
# Use code with caution.
```

## Creating Your First Project

<Steps>
Generate the Project
Once the CLI is available, use the create command to scaffold a new project. Replace `my-bunxyz-app` with your desired project name:

```bash
bunxyz create my-bunxyz-app
# Use code with caution.
```

This command creates a new directory with the specified name and populates it with a basic Bunxyz project template.

### Navigate to Project Directory

Change into your newly created project folder:

```bash
cd my-bunxyz-app
# Use code with caution.
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies (including bunxyz itself) using Bun:

```bash
bun install
# Use code with caution.
```

</Steps>

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server with hot reloading enabled, run:

```bash
bun dev
# Use code with caution.
```

Bunxyz will start the server, typically on http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to your source files (.ts files) will automatically trigger a server restart.

You should see output similar to this in your console:

```log
ðŸ¦Š Bunxyz server running at http://localhost:3000
# Use code with caution.
```

You can now open your browser and navigate to the running application! Try accessing the default `/api` route provided in the template.

## Project Structure (Default Template)

The `bunxyz create` command generates the following essential structure:

```plaintext
my-bunxyz-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/             # Directory for File-Based Routing
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts     # Example route handler for /api
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts         # Main application entry point (App initialization)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore           # Git ignore file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Project configuration and dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
```

### src/index.ts:

This is the main entry point where you initialize the App instance and start the server.

### src/api/:

This directory holds your route handlers when using the convention-based File-Based Routing system.

Now that you have your project running, let's dive into the Core Concepts.
